# pydotART
Programmatically generate patterns based on your Lego® DOTS™ collection and canvas size

You need to supply the area to cover, the available DOTS™ and a sub-pattern.
There are different functions available to apply that pattern to the canvas.
Outputs can be a building plan or LDraw digital representation.
